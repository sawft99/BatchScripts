# Batch-Scripts
* Cleanup.bat - Cleanup of Windows PC to reclaim some space.
   * Outdated at this point as it was made for XP. Though much of it will likely still work.
   * Originally inspired by [Tron repo](https://github.com/bmrf/tron).
* Info Tool.bat - Gather hardware and network info of Windows PC. Also perform some basic network tests.
* Repair.bat - Runs SFC, DISM, CHKDSK, and CHKNTFS commands.
